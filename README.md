# How to Import Twine Files

One way to import Twine files into Yarn is to export a "Twee" file from Twine. (txt format) Open this txt file in Yarn as you would any other file.

Note: This method of importing will not preserve node locations, just each node's title, body and tags.

# How to Run Source as an App

Download http://nwjs.io/ for your platform and extract the contents.

Win64: ...

MacOS: Place source code in a new folder named "app.nw" inside the extracted nwjs.app's "Contents/Resources/" folder.
